# Name-that-animal
For my first hackathon, my friend and I created a simple website where the user names animals. There are two game modes, easy and hard, and the user has 1:00 to name animals. For the animal pictures, we used a csv database and split the animals into easy and hard animals.
Here is the link to the website: https://project.frankf.repl.co/
